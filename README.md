# Corryvreckan
### The Maelstrom for Your Test Beam Data

For more details about the project please have a look at the website at https://cern.ch/corryvreckan.

[![build status](https://gitlab.cern.ch/simonspa/corryvreckan/badges/master/build.svg)](https://gitlab.cern.ch/simonspa/corryvreckan/commits/master)

## Dependencies
* [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/building-root) (required, with the GenVector component)

## Installation
The CMake build system is used for compilation and installation. The install directory can be specified by adding `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>` as argument to the CMake command below. Other configuration options are explained in the manual.

The dependencies need to be initialized for the build to succeed.

### Compilation
To compile and install a default installation of Corryvreckan, run the following commands

```
$ mkdir build && cd build/
$ cmake ..
$ make install
```

For more detailed installation instructions, please refer to the documentation below.

### Uninstallation
To uninstall and remove compilation files (e.g. when you want to do a clean recompilation/reinstallation):

```
$ rm -r build/ lib/ bin/
```

N.B. This assumes you used the above commands to compile and install. Adjust the paths accordingly if you used a different `build` directory and/or `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` option.

## Documentation
The PDF user manual is automatically compiled by the continuous integration and can be [downloaded here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/corryvreckan/corryvreckan/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/public/usermanual/corryvreckan-manual.pdf?job=cmp%3Ausermanual).

The latest PDF version of the User Manual can be created from source by executing
```
$ make pdf
```
After running the manual is available under `usermanual/corryvreckan-manual.pdf` in the build directory.

To build the HTML version of the latest Doxygen reference, run the following command
```
$ make reference
```
The main page of the reference can then be found at `reference/html/index.html` in the build folder.
